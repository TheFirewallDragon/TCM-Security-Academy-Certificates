<h2>External Pentest Playbook</h2>
<p>
Completing "The External Pentest Playbook" course has significantly enriched my skills in external network penetration testing. This course focuses on tactics and techniques essential for enhancing one's pentesting abilities. It helped me gain a deeper understanding of the external pentest attack methodology and mindset, refine my pentesting skillset, and even better my client relations. The course covered a wide range of concepts, including objectives of an external pentest, scope verification, client communication, attack strategies, vulnerability scanning, OSINT, attacking various online platforms, bypassing MFA, and report writing. It also emphasized identifying common pentest findings and conducting client debriefs, retests, and attestations. This comprehensive training has not only improved my pentesting capabilities but has also prepared me for pentest job interviews.

<h2>Linux 101</h2>
<p>
Completing the "Linux 101" course has provided me with a solid foundation in using Linux. This course is ideal for beginners with no prior experience using Linux, and it covers essential, practical information without unnecessary filler content. I learned how to use common Linux commands and utilities, find help on new commands, work with advanced shell concepts like pipes and command substitution, navigate the Linux filesystem hierarchy, use regular expressions for search and filtering, perform basic administrative actions, and even develop short Linux shell scripts. This knowledge has been invaluable in gaining confidence and proficiency with Linux, making it a valuable addition to my skillset.

<h2>Linux Privilege Escalation for Beginners</h2>
<p>
I completed the "Linux Privilege Escalation for Beginners" course, which provided knowledge and practical experience in Linux privilege escalation. This course is perfect for those looking to enhance their skills in privilege escalation, especially for Capture the Flag challenges and preparing for certifications like OSCP. The course covers various privilege escalation techniques, including kernel exploits, password hunting, file permissions, Sudo attacks, shell escaping, and many others. The instructor, Heath Adams, aka "The Cyber Mentor," does an excellent job explaining concepts and providing engaging content.
